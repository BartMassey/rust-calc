# Calc: Iterated calculator of things
Copyright (c) 2018 Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, Bart Massey

This "calculator" code is loosely based on the GCD utility
from Chapter 2 of the O'Reilly *Programming Rust* book by
Blandy and Orendorff. It allows specification of any of four
functions — *sum*, *product*, *gcd*, *lcm* — as well as a
sequence of positive integers to apply them to.
